    Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller. It's extremely minimalistic and uses a syntax of 8 symbols.
    The symbols meaning are as follows:
    <table style="padding-left: 5">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Symbol</th>
                <th style="text-align: left">Meaning</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>></td>
                <td>increment the data pointer</td>
                </tr>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><</td>
                <td>decrement the data pointer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>+</td>
                <td>increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-</td>
                <td>decrement (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
